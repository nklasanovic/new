            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
              Since my childhood, I was into computers and games. Especially
              games. These two became something very special to me. I remember
              clearly, like it was yesterday. Me at the age of six, one of those
              cold winter nights and Max Payne in bullet-time "doing his thing"
              on my monitor. Such a precious memory of mine. Also, turned out it
              became my favorite game of all time. Because it contains the best
              things in gaming for me. Engaging gameplay combined with
              well-written & memorable characters and meaningful story. The most
              important things I look for in games even to this day. Now, I tend
              to play all sorts of genres and I enjoy every single minute of
              doing that. Characters from games aren't just some pixels on the
              screen to me, they're much more than that. Like that Max Payne
              isn't just some random dude trying to live an American dream.

                  I used to create an engaging content in the view of columns.
                  Also, I used to cover fresh and the most imporant news of
                  gaming world.

                  As I already mentioned, I consider myself as a gaming fan and
                  enjoyer. So, presumably, I used to (and still do) create
                  content about games. To say the least, I see games and
                  everything that surrounds them as a part of my living world.
